CS 260 Startup Application

## Elevator Pitch

### Fish tanks in an aqurium -- still working on the name
The application is a simple social media that allows users to create and join private spaces called aquariums. In each aquarium, users maintain a unique fish tank. Users can customize the shape of their tank, the fish, and the decorations in the tank. Users can communicate in the application by sharing a simple status such as `:)`, `at work`, or `zzz` though their fish. Users will also see if another user in the same aquarium is active at the same time.
