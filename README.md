### Some stuff I found interesting
* I am a little bit confued about the difference between commiting a change and pushing it
* The git extension in VS Code makes it really easy to work with git
* Can anyone modify my code if they clone the repository? Or do they only clone a copy of it to their development environment?
* The applications of this collaborative repository structure are essentially endless
